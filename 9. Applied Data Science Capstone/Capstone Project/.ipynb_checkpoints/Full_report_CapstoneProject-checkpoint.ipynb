An client is looking to open a new **Italian restaurant** in Sydney, however, he is not sure about the best location and marketing strategy for his new venue. So you are assigned to help him to develop a comprehensive marketing program. Sydney is a vibrant city that shines all year with spectacular events. It is best known for its tourist attractions and idyllic beaches. Strolling around the city suburbs, it hardly find a clean niche to open up a new restaurants among established competitors without a data-driven methodology. How would you advise your client in deciding his restaurant location using data science?"

    "Through out this data analysis pipeline, we started from understanding the problem to acheiving final results by using web-scraping, Folium map, Foursquare API and K-mean clustering. We identified 5 candidate suburbs out from total 698 suburbs from Sydney metro area that meet the requirments (low property price, high population, middle age range and least competitors) for opening up an Italian restaurant. Further looking into the restaurant profile of these 5 suburbs, considering the diversity of restaurant types, both **Randwick** and **Chatswood** are stand out. The diverse restaurant types within a given suburb may imply that the local customers are willing to try new things and hence provide realatively easy-to-survive operating enviornment for a new restaurant in our case. In addition, if we consider location factor between these two suburbs, Randwick has an clear advantage over Chatswood. Coogee beach is within one kilometer from the centre of Randwick. The Univeristy of New South Wales also locates next to Randwick, which provides a large potential customer pool from all around the world. Most importantly, with the newly operated [Sydney light rail](https://sydneylightrail.transport.nsw.gov.au/), potential customers from CBD only need further 15-20min to get to Randwick.   "

   "metadata": {},
   "source": [
    "Taken together, Randwick is the final suburb we should consider to open up a Italian restaurant. We also should note that this is just a very primitive analysis using public datasets. We are only able to solve a few factors that are significant in selecting restaurant location. For example, we have yet to address the demographic composition, the customer flow rate and parking space. These information could enable us to further understand the operation feseabiliy of italian restaurant within Randwick area. Nevertheless, this analysis showcases the magic power of data science in solving real-world problems. "
